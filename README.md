This repo is my experience and code with big data technologies, including Kafka, Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch. All the code is written in Python. Kafka as the high volume data transmitter, Cassandra as the NoSQL database, Spark can do streaming process, ElasticSearch as the fast search engine, node.js as the front end server.
